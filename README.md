watchdog-tricks
===============

This package includes several useful `Tricks` for `watchdog` (Python API for monitoring file system events, https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog).

Tricks could be running in standalone mode or combined via a configuration file. They will perform specific tasks upon file change event.

- CheckBeforeAutoRestartTrick: Provided a check process exits successfully Restart a process on source code changes
- TouchFileTrick: Useful to chain together changes in alternative directories and then touch a file in a core directory

Configuration File - trick.yaml
-------------------------------
The true power of watchdog tricks is shown via configuration files, which could combine different tricks together and give you a fully automated development and building system.

Put the configuration file to the root directory that needs to be monitored. Assume the filename is `tricks.yaml`. To run watchdog with this configuration file

    $ watchmedo tricks tricks.yaml
